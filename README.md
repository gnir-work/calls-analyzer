## Calls metadata
This repo contains a small python script which knows how to index a csv generated by [callyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.websoptimization.callyzer&hl=en) into an elk stack.

## usage
1. Start up the elk via `docker-compose up elk` inside of the repository's directory
2. run `python main.py`, this will index `calls.csv` into the elk
3. Go to `localhost:5602` and configure your kibana to your liking :)
